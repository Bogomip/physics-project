# The Physics Project (<a href="https://physics.sweeto.co.uk/#/">Live Site</a>!)

This website is a playground for testing algorithms and simulations for use by students who need simulated data matching real world data. The simulations are real life physical phenomina which allow students to collect data in a more real world sense (i.e. error is usually inherent!) than what many simulations provide. This site also is a playground for other creations, such as my random data generator, random questions generators, maze and pathfinding algorithms, and my practices at neural networks (following tutorials).

## Tech

The Physics Project was made in Angular2, with the only persistence through localstorage. There is no backend or databasing involved and unlikely to be in the near future.

## Future Plans

This site is a persistent work in progress as its where I try fun new things, however a few plans I have include:

- [ ] A new random question generator format
- [ ] Finalising the Alpha and Beta simulations
- [ ] Building the neural network road simulation
- [ ] Using the mapping and pathfinding packages to create a game

But these are low priority goals, and if more intreresting things come along I will focus on them first!

## Thanks

Note that whilst the majority of the work on this site is made just by me, some features below have leaned heavily on other resources for learning, the main being:

- The neural network self driving simulator was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_rAxEsAvI">tutorial</a> learned via FreeCodeCamp and written by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3XGlNq8O5hZlZBJlSFB4jg">Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor</a>.
- The maze algorithms were all adapted from pseudocode on <a href="https://www.jamisbuck.org/mazes/">Jamisbuck</a>, which is the goto place for mazes info!
